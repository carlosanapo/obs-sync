Here is a an introduction for the conference paper about loss prevention. The paper deal with the atmospheric dispersion characterization of supersonic underexpanded jet under the influence of an Atmospheric Boundary Layer. 


The introduction is divided into the following sections:
- Part 1: Introduction about the importance of loss prevention
- Part 2: Importance of atmospheric dispersion of supersonic underexpanded jet
- Part 3: Importance of the paper
- Part 4: Structure of the paper

Key points to add in the introduction:
- The air dispersion modeler often runs into basic problems, for example: where exactly is located the source on the available domain? How does the emission can be estimated? Where I can find representative ABL data (shape, height, wind speed, etc.)? How to choose the right model for the simulation? How to validate the model? 
- predictions can only be as much accurate as the experimental data used to validate the model. 
- Often the goodness of the available data is not questioned and the model is validated against it. 
- The ideal scenario is to have enough quality  experimental data based on the same conditions as the model. 
- One another important issue is governement databases are inherently incomplete and so biased. Only emissions greater than a predefined threshold value are required by law. Potentially dangerous emissions from small sources may be consequently ignored.
