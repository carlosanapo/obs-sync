The experimental investigation has been conducted at the subsonic low speed closed loop wind tunnel located at the von Karman Institute. 

Description of L1 and boundary layer

Compressed air from a (green tank volume) passes through a 30 meters long 2inch pipe and reach a 100 L tank. 
The latter has a cylindrical shape $\approx 400 \times 800$ mm (diameter x length) horizontally oriented. At the center of it there is a manhole (i.e. a flange) equipped with a interchangeable nozzle. 
The nozzles tested have a constant section throat $D_n$ for a total of $32 \ \mathrm{mm}$ in height. 

Atomizer principal: multiple Laskin nozzles in x-configuration (two layers)
45 individual air jets with according liquid holes in metric fittings Fully adjustable through the manual control of 45 Laskin nozzles 
Typical particle size: 1.0 Î¼m peak in PDF of size distribution 
Tested seeding material: Ondina x420 (Shell) medicinal grade mineral oil
Typical seed output per jet: App. 108 particles/second

A typical test consist of first pressurizing the main tank at the desired test pressure and continuously releasing the jet. Once the jet is stable the seeding system release the oil tracers inside a an intermediate tank (which has the same volume of the main one). The latter is then pressurized from the supply tank at the same pressure of the main testing tank with the addition of a small $\Delta p$ needed to overcome the pressure of the main tank and consequently to allow the release of the tracers inside the main testing tank. The pressurization of the tracer particles in a intermediate tank was necessary because of the higher $p_0$ inside the main tank, which would have otherwise prevented the release of the tracers from the laskin nozzle generator.
