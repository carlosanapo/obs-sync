# Subsonic Closed Loop Wind Tunnel Facility

- Test are conducted inside the close loop subsonic wind tunnel located at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics. 
- The closed test section consist of a rectangular duct (2 x 3 x 20)
- 2 contra rotating fans driven by a 580 kW DC allow a max speed of 60 m/s
- The longitudinal length of the test section is used to model the desired boundary layer    
- If necessary, the ceiling of the wind tunnel can be adjusted to control the longitudinal pressure-loss over the tunnel test-section and to overcome blockage effects.
