As already introduced in the previous section the nozzle shape here tested aimed at replicating a hole that may occur in a pressurized device.
Straight circular nozzles has been selected.
2 different diameter $D_1 = 5 \ \textrm{mm}$ and $D_2 = 8 \ \textrm{mm}$.
The length  of the the nozzles is constant for both of the nozzles $l_n = 32 \ \textrm{mm}$. 
The resulting aspect ratios are $AR_1 = 0.15625$ and $AR_2 = 0.25$. 
As stated by the nozzle theory for such a nozzle given a sufficient upstream total pressure you'll end up with a throat condition correspondent to the choking condition $Ma =1$ . 
The reader may erroneously consider that this condition correspond also to the exit condition. 
That is not the case. 
First of all, because of the sharp edge nozzle (90 degrees) the fluid stream line coming the side of the tank must suddenly turn.
It creates 2 stagnation point right after the edge, inside the nozzle at the annulus wall.
A fictional convergent, nozzle is established and the choking condition is reached in correspondence of it.
It is worth mentioning that the new throat is smaller in diameter with respect to the geometrical one.
later it naturally tends to continue the expansion creating so the divergent section, helped also by the vanishing of the previously mentioned stagnation region. 
Because of the confined flow a new feature is being established: an annulus boundary layer covering the internal surface of the nozzle. 
In parallel to this, going back to the just established CV-DV fictional nozzle, the flow leaving the throat tends to accelerate (Ma > 1). an expansion fan is also being established. 
Through it Mach will tend to increase the alternating shocks will interfere also with the boundary lager growing
