As already introduced in the previous section the nozzle shape here tested aimed at replicating a hole that may occur in a pressurized device.
Straight circular nozzles has been selected.
2 different diameter $D_1 = 5 \ \textrm{mm}$ and $D_2 = 8 \ \textrm{mm}$.
The length  of the the nozzles is constant for both of the nozzles $l_n = 32 \ \textrm{mm}$. 
The resulting aspect ratios are $AR_1 = 0.15625$ and $AR_2 = 0.25$. 
As stated by the nozzle theory for such a nozzle given a sufficient upstream total pressure you'll end up with a throat condition correspondent to the choking condition $Ma =1$ . 
The reader may erroneously consider that this condition correspond also to the ambient exit condition. 
That is not the case. 
First of all, because of the sharp edge nozzle (90 degrees) the fluid stream line coming the side of the tank must suddenly turn.
It creates 2 stagnation point right after the edge, inside the nozzle at the annulus wall.
A fictional convergent, nozzle is established and the choking condition is reached in correspondence of it.
It is worth mentioning that the new throat is smaller in diameter with respect to the geometrical one.
later it naturally tends to continue the expansion creating so the divergent section, helped also by the vanishing of the previously mentioned stagnation region. 
Because of the confined flow a new feature is being established: an annulus boundary layer covering the internal surface of the nozzle. 
In parallel to this, going back to the just established CV-DV fictional nozzle, the flow leaving the throat tends to accelerate (Ma > 1). an expansion fan is also being established. 
Through it Mach will tend to increase the alternating shocks will interfere also with the boundary lager growing

As introduced in the previous section, the nozzle geometry investigated here was chosen to replicate a puncture or hole that might form in a pressurized device. To emulate this scenario, **straight circular nozzles** were selected, representing a simplified yet relevant approximation of such accidental flow paths.

Two diameters were considered: D1=5 mmD_1 = 5 \ \text{mm}D1​=5 mm and D2=8 mmD_2 = 8 \ \text{mm}D2​=8 mm, while the nozzle length was kept constant at ln=32 mml_n = 32 \ \text{mm}ln​=32 mm for both. This results in aspect ratios of AR1=0.156AR_1 = 0.156AR1​=0.156 and AR2=0.25AR_2 = 0.25AR2​=0.25, respectively.

According to classical nozzle theory, when the upstream total pressure is sufficiently high, the flow reaches **choking conditions**—that is, a Mach number of 1—at the throat. However, it is important to clarify that **this choking condition does not occur at the physical exit** of the nozzle.

Instead, the flow behavior is shaped significantly by the sharp 90-degree entry edge of the nozzle. Fluid streamlines approaching from the tank must turn abruptly into the nozzle, creating two stagnation points just downstream of the edge—along the inner annular wall. This sudden redirection effectively forms a **virtual converging section** inside the straight nozzle.

It is within this virtual converging region that the flow chokes, meaning the effective "throat" is not located at the nozzle exit but rather upstream, at a location with a **smaller effective area** than the nozzle’s full bore. Beyond this point, the flow continues to expand naturally, forming a virtual **divergent section** downstream as the stagnation region collapses and streamlines reattach.

This confined flow gives rise to another key feature: an **annular boundary layer** develops along the nozzle walls. Meanwhile, in the core of the flow—downstream of the virtual throat—acceleration resumes, and **supersonic conditions emerge** (i.e., Ma>1Ma > 1Ma>1). An **expansion fan** forms as part of this transition, supporting further acceleration.

However, this process is not smooth. As the flow accelerates, **shock waves** form and interact with the growing boundary layer, producing a complex and unsteady structure where shocks and expansion waves alternate and feed back into the nozzle interior. This interaction is critical for understanding both the internal flowfield and the development of the **underexpanded jet** downstream.

The **aspect ratio** of the nozzle, although geometrically simple, plays a nontrivial role in shaping this behavior. A larger aspect ratio (i.e., a longer nozzle for the same diameter) allows more axial development of both the boundary layer and the expansion process. This can lead to a **greater degree of acceleration**, potentially increasing the **exit Mach number** and making the jet **more severely underexpanded**. Conversely, shorter nozzles (lower aspect ratio) limit this development, possibly resulting in a lower effective exit velocity and weaker expansion features.

**As a final remark**, although the actual exit Mach number varies across test conditions, the **reference velocity used for non-dimensionalization** has been chosen as the one corresponding to **choking conditions (Ma = 1)**. This allows all test cases to be consistently scaled, since the **total upstream temperature remains constant** and solely determines the sonic velocity at the throat. This choice ensures a uniform basis for comparing velocity fields across varying configurations, independent of changes in diameter or pressure ratio.
