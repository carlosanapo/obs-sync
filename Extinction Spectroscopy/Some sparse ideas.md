Here are some potential topic to investigate:
Post-processing analysis of a transmittance spectrum can yield valuable insights about the sample being studied. Here are some common types of analyses that can be performed:

1. **Baseline Correction**: Remove any baseline drift or offset that might skew the interpretation of the spectrum. E.g.
		1. Wavelet transform analysis
		2. Asymmetric least squares

3. **Peak Identification**: Identify and assign peaks in the spectrum to specific molecular transitions. This helps in understanding the chemical composition and structure of the sample.

4. **Quantitative Analysis**: Use the area under specific peaks or the height of peaks to quantify the concentration of substances in the sample. This can be done using Beer-Lambert Law which relates absorbance to concentration.

5. **Deconvolution**: Separate overlapping peaks into their individual components to better understand complex mixtures.

6. **Fourier Transform**: Apply Fourier Transform techniques to convert the data from the time domain to the frequency domain for further analysis, especially in IR and NMR spectroscopy.

7. **Derivative Spectroscopy**: Use first or second derivatives of the spectrum to enhance the resolution of overlapping peaks and improve peak identification.

8. **Multivariate Analysis**: Apply techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to extract more complex information and identify patterns in the spectral data.

9. **Spectral Fitting**: Fit the spectral data to theoretical models to extract parameters such as peak positions, widths, and areas, which can be related to physical properties of the sample.

10. **Comparison with Libraries**: Compare the obtained spectrum with reference spectra from spectral libraries to identify unknown substances in the sample.

11. **Kinetic Analysis**: If the spectrum is recorded over time, analyze the changes to study reaction kinetics or stability of the sample.

12. **Band Gap Analysis**: For materials like semiconductors, the transmittance spectrum can be used to determine the band gap by identifying the onset of absorption.

Each of these analyses can provide different types of information about the sample, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its properties and composition.

# How to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze spectra and remove noise

Here is a general procedure for using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze spectra and remove noise:

1. **Collect the Spectrum**: Obtain the spectrum of interest using a spectrometer or other analytical instrument.

2. **Preprocess the Data**: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as baseline correction, normalization, or smoothing to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Apply the FFT**: Use a library or built-in function to apply the FFT to the spectrum data. This will transform the data from the time domain to the frequency domain. Attention: my spectrum is already in the frequency domain: specifically it is the transmittance spectrum of a sample. obtained after an integration of the absorbance spectrum in the UV-Vis region for a specific time. 
4. **Analyze the Frequency Domain**: Examine the transformed data to identify noise frequencies or other patterns that may be present in the spectrum.
5. **Filter the Data**: Apply filters or other processing techniques to remove noise or unwanted frequencies from the spectrum. Common filters include low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.
