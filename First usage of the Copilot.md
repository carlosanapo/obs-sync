Let's see if the copilot is working properly:

# Numba module

The Numba module is a just-in-time compiler for Python that works best on code that uses NumPy arrays and functions, and loops. It is a great way to speed up your code without having to rewrite it in a lower-level language like C or Fortran.

Numba works by translating Python code into machine code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. It can also generate CUDA code for running on NVIDIA GPUs.

Here is an example of how to use Numba to speed up a simple function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import jit

@jit
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        total += num
    return total

arr = np.random.rand(1000000)
print(sum_array(arr))
```

This code will run much faster with Numba than without it, especially for larger arrays.

Here is a more advanced example of using Numba to speed up a function that calculate the fft of a 2D array:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import jit

@jit
def fft2d(arr):
    return np.fft.fft2(arr)

arr = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
print(fft2d(arr))
```
